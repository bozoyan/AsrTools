1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,060
it's funny the things you forget 

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,810
i uh i won't see my mother the other day 

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,330
and she told me this story 

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,050
that i i completely forgotten about 

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,210
how when we were driving together 

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,570
she would pull the car over 

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,820
and by the time she got out the car 

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,340
and gone round the car to let me out the car 

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,180
i would have already got out the car 

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,920
and pretended to have died 

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,280
哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,520
because that's how you die 

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,260
and i remember that was uh 

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,500
that was a game i used to play 

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,820
with myself to entertain myself 

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,020
whenever i was bored or or frustrated 

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,250
settle down people say 

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,330
we live in an age of information overloaded 

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,290
right i don't know about that 

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,010
but i just know that i get too many marketing emails 

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,080
i got ua marketeamer from a ua supermarket firm 

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,720
which uh will remain nameless 

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,880
for predominantly legal reasons 

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
but which i'm gonna call uh safe mart 

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
i got anymore from them 

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
and it said it well like this 

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,780
it said um just three weeks until safe marked 

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,060
at king's cross opens 

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,500
and i resented this 

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,990
because not only do i not remember signing up to that 

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,350
but i i resent the fact that there 

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,390
they appear to think that i should be excited 

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,270
about a shop opening 

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,400
so what i did is i um 

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,760
i scroll down to the bottom of the email 

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,360
and i pressed unsubscribed 

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,310
and i thought that would be the end of it 

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,190
but a week later i got another one 

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,660
that said just two weeks until safe martyking's cross opens 

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,660
i thought well obviously i haven't clicked hard enough 

41
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,340
right so i i tried it again 

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,760
right low and behold the week passes 

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,900
you guessed it just one week until safe martyking's cross opens 

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,820
and here's the problem 

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,900
the internet gave us access to everything 

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,740
but it also gave everything access to us 

47
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,810
you know i i think right 

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,450
it's hard enough to discriminate between the things 

49
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,090
that genuinely matter in this world 

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,910
and you know the minishi of life 

51
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,630
without having emails about supermarket chains 

52
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,870
and candy crush saga 

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,740
and i was really annoyed with them 

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,820
and i thought okay i should just 

55
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,740
i was about to write a strongly word email 

56
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,500
so i can do quite well 

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,180
and i thought no i'm gonna find the game 

58
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,860
so i replied to it 

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,700
and i said i literally cannot wait 

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,080
what do you need from me 

61
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,460
they go back to me it's sky called dan 

62
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,540
said hi james have asked the colleague 

63
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,700
to help me with your query 

64
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,300
like it needs help 

65
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,500
i said what's the plan then 

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,220
i'm thinking fireworks bouncy castle 

67
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,190
i'm not sure what you mean 

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,830
i said i'm just tremendously excited about the opening 

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,620
do you want to put the bouncy castle or shi 

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,300
he said i i think you have misunderstood 

71
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,300
a new store is opening 

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,820
but there is no celebration plan 

73
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,910
i said but what was all the three weeks until 

74
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,310
two weeks until emails 

75
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,990
i was getting excited 

76
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,690
i'm sorry you're disappointed 

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,280
i said not to worry let's do something anyway 

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,000
besides the deposit on the bounty castle 

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,660
was not refundable if we don't use it 

80
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,940
we're out a few hundred quid 

81
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,560
dan he said mr vitchi not responsible 

82
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,640
for anything you have ordered 

83
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,290
i said let's not get into who did what 

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,839
bottom line you and i are in this together 

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,540
question would you be there 

86
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,860
to make sure people take their shoes off 

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,480
and i'll be honest uh 

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
then my relationship with dan deteriorated somewhat 

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,200
because the next email i got was this 

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,800
thanks to emo your case number is 

91
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,020
oh it's outrageous i said dan 

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,420
and i go and i was just like this is all right 

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,740
and i i i said dann 

94
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,950
and he just it just kept kept up 

95
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,470
and i thought this is terrible 

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,950
i'm doing is collecting case numbers 

97
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,140
i said i said d dog the store is now open 

98
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,660
i said but danny must have wonder 

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,240
why there was no patty castle 

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,480
and then we were back to this 

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,440
and that might have been the end of the story 

102
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,090
but i remember that anything everything 

103
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,810
even something as mundane as getting out of a car 

104
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,190
can be fun if you find the right game 

105
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,920
so this is what i applied 

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,600
and we just uh we like we were dancing 

107
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,710
it was just a beautiful relationship 

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,190
we just kept kept going 

109
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,430
and it was it was it was lovely 

110
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,590
but to be honest guys 

111
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,490
it was quite labor intensive 

112
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,210
and um you know i had other stuff to do 

113
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,690
believe it or not 

114
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,220
and so uh why did i have a little uh 

115
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,900
i have a little um uh email auto replier program 

116
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,510
and what i do is i set it up 

117
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,230
so every time it receives an email from safe mit 

118
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,430
just pings one back right 

119
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,670
so i set it up and it says 

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,200
thanks to emo your case number is 

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,840
and then it has a little formula that i wrote 

122
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,480
uh to up the case number every time 

123
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,340
and i put it on the server and said it running 

124
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
i'll i'll be honest guys 

125
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,500
then then i forgot about it 

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,900
i check back on it the other day 

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,340
uh i appears um there being a number of emails going 

128
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,790
uh back and we're on twenty one thousand four hundred 

129
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,700
it gives me an immense sense of satisfaction 

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,340
to know that these computer programs 

131
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,780
are just gonna be pinging one another 

132
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,460
you know for for eternity 

133
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,770
and his legacies go 

134
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,890
i don't i don't think that's bad 

135
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,380
so guys just remember right 

136
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,460
if you ever you feel weighed down by the 

137
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,700
you know the bureaucracy and often mdanity of modern life 

138
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,450
don't fight the frustration 

139
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,400
let it be the catalyst for whimsy 

140
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,270
哈哈哈哈哈哈

141
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,750
thank you
