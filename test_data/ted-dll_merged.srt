1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,150
so in college i was a government major

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,390
which means i had to write a lot of papers

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,470
now when a

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,110
normal student writes a paper they might spread the workout a little like this

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,700
so you know you

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,500
get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,620
that with some heavier days later on everything gets done 

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,290
things stay civil and i would want to do that like that 

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,400
that would be the plan i would uh i would have it all ready to go 

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,920
but then then then actually the people would would come along 

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
and then i would kind of do this and that 

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,240
would happen every single paper 

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,440
but then came my ninety page senior thesis paper 

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,720
you're supposed to spend a year on 

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,070
i knew for a paper like that my normal work flow was not an option 

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,310
it was way too big a project 

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,810
so i planned things out and i decided it kind of had to go 

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,330
something like this this is how the year would go 

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,489
so i'd start off light and i'd bump it up in the middle months 

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,010
and then at the end i would kick it up into high gears 

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,090
took a little staircase how hard could you just walk up the stairs 

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,690
no big deal right 

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,500
but then funniest thing happened those first few months 

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,700
they came and went and i i couldn't quite do stuff 

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,020
so we had an awesome new revised plan 

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,200
and then but then those middle months actually went by 

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
and i didn't really write words 

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,260
and so we were here and then two months turned into one month 

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,700
she turned into two weeks and one day 

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,460
i woke up with three days until the deadline 

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,620
still not having written a word 

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,540
and so i did the only thing i could 

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,810
i wrote ninety pages over seventy two hours 

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,610
pulling not one but two all nighters 

35
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,250
humans are not supposed to pull two all nighters 

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,020
sprinted across campus dove in slow motion 

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,060
and guided in just of the deadline 

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,900
and i thought that was the end of everything 

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
but a week later i get a call 

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,850
it's the school and they say is this tim urban 

41
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,810
and i say yeah 

42
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,210
and they say we need to talk about your thesis 

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,570
and i say okay 

44
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,990
and they say it's the best one we've ever seen 

45
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:29,640
a that did not happen 

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,760
it was a very very bad thesis 

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,040
i just wanted to enjoy that one moment 

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,680
when all of you thought this guy is amazing 

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,420
no no it was very very bad anyway 

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,100
today i'm a writer blogger guy 

51
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,660
i write the blog weight but why 

52
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,660
and a couple of years ago i decided to write about procrastination 

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,380
my behavior is always perplexed 

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,020
the non procrastinators around me 

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,380
and i wanted to explain to the non procrastinators 

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,560
of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators 

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
and why we are the where we are now 

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,340
at a hypothesis that the the brains of procrastinators 

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,300
were actually different than the brains of other people 

60
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,610
and to test this i found an mri lab 

61
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,650
that actually let me scan both my brain 

62
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,290
and the brain of a proven non procrastinator 

63
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,890
and i and so i could compare them 

64
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,130
and i actually brought them here to show you today 

65
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,530
and i want you to take a look carefully 

66
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,810
to see if you can notice a difference 

67
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,850
and i know that if you're not a trained brain expert 

68
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,210
it's not that obvious 

69
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,370
but just take a look okay 

70
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,250
so here's the brain of a non procrastinator 

71
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,670
哈哈哈哈

72
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,440
now here's my brain 哈哈哈哈

73
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,500
there is a difference 

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
both brains have a rational decision maker in them 

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,430
but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey 

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,230
now what does this mean for the procrastinator 

77
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,210
well means everything's fine until this happens 

78
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
so the rational decision maker will make the rational decision 

79
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,860
to do something productive 

80
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,700
but the monkey doesn't like that plan 

81
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,150
so he she takes the wheel 

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,450
and he says actually let's read the entire wikipedia page 

83
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,450
of the nancy kerrigan tanya harding scandal 

84
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,050
because i just remember that that happened 

85
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,300
then we're gonna go over to the fridge 

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,500
we're gonna see if there's anything new in there 

87
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,540
since ten minutes ago 

88
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,870
after that we're gonna go on a youtube spiral 

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,290
that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets 

90
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,890
and ends much much later with us watching interviews 

91
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,250
with justin bieber's mom 

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,380
all that's gonna take a while 

93
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,660
so we're not gonna really have room on the schedule 

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,840
now what is going on here 

95
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,900
the instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel 

96
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,580
he lives entirely in the present moment 

97
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,700
he has no memory of the past 

98
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,980
no knowledge of the future 

99
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
and he only cares about two things 

100
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,260
easy and fun 

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,040
now in the animal world 

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
that works fine if you're a dog 

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,240
and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things 

104
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,360
you're a huge success 

105
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,820
and to the monkey 

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
humans are just another animal species 

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
is to keep well 

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,000
slept well 

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,360
fed and propagating into the next generation 

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
which in tribal times 

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
might have worked okay 

112
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
but if you haven't noticed 

113
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,080
now we're not in tribal times 

114
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,250
we're in an advanced civilization 

115
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,090
and the monkey does not know what that is 

116
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,490
which is why we have another guy in our brain 

117
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,540
the rational decision maker 

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,750
who gives us the ability to do things 

119
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,190
no other animal can do 

120
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,270
we can visualize the future 

121
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
we can see the big picture 

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
we can make long term plans 

123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
and he wants to take all of that into account 

124
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,650
and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense 

125
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,090
to be doing right now 

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
now sometimes it makes sense 

127
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,000
to be doing things that are easy and fun 

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
like when you're having dinner 

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
or going to bed 

130
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,600
or enjoying well 

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,520
or in leisure time 

132
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,270
that's why there's an overlap 

133
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
sometimes they agree 

134
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,670
but other times it makes much more sense 

135
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,460
to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant 

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,900
for the sake of the big picture 

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,860
and that's when we have a conflict 

138
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,730
and for the procrastinator 

139
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,530
that conflict tends to end a certain way 

140
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,050
every time 

141
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,930
leaving him spending a lot of time 

142
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,530
in this orange zone 

143
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,860
an easy and fun place 

144
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,460
that's entirely out of the makes sense circle 

145
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,460
i call it the dark playground 

146
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,670
the dark playground is a place 

147
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,830
that all of you procrastinators out there 

148
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,630
know very well 

149
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
it's where leisure activities happen 

150
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
at times when leisure activities 

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
are not supposed to be happening 

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
the fun you have in the dark playground 

153
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
isn't actually fun 

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,800
because it's completely unearned 

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,760
and the air is filled with 

156
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,910
guilt dread anxiety 

157
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,510
self hatred 

158
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,390
all those good procrastinator feelings 

159
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,980
and the question is 

160
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
in this situation 

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,380
with the monkey behind the wheel 

162
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,620
how does the procrastinator ever get himself 

163
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,060
over here to this blue zone 

164
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,090
a less pleasant plates but were really important things happen 

165
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,740
well it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel 

166
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,500
someone who's always looking down on him 

167
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,580
and watching over him 

168
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,100
in his darkest moments 

169
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,460
someone called the panic monster 

170
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,270
the panic monster is dormant 

171
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,910
most of the time 

172
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,190
but he suddenly wakes up 

173
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,770
any time a deadline gets too close 

174
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,650
or there's danger of 

175
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,610
public embarrassment 

176
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,730
career disaster 

177
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,290
or some other scary consequence 

178
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,260
and importantly 

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,380
he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of 

180
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,150
now he became very relevant in my life 

181
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,590
pretty recently 

182
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,570
because people of ted reached out to me 

183
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,570
about six months ago 

184
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,130
and invited me to do a ted talk 

185
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,440

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
