1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,150
so in college i was a government major 

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,390
which means i had to write a lot of papers 

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,510
now when a normal student writes a paper 

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,110
they might spread the workout a little like this 

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,940
so you know you get started maybe a little slowly 

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,500
but you get enough done in the first week 

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,220
that with some heavier days later on 

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,780
everything gets done things stay civil 

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,290
and i would want to do that like that 

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,570
that would be the plan 

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,400
i would uh i would have it all ready to go 

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,320
but then then then actually the people would 

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,080
would come along and then i would kind of do this 

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
and that would happen every single paper 

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,440
but then came my ninety page senior thesis paper 

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,720
you're supposed to spend a year on 

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,590
i knew for a paper like that 

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,070
my normal work flow was not an option 

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,310
it was way too big a project 

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,110
so i planned things out and i decided 

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,490
it kind of had to go something like this 

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
this is how the year would go 

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,690
so i'd start off light and i'd bump it up 

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,170
in the middle months and then at the end 

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,010
i would kick it up into high gears 

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,970
took a little staircase 

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,090
how hard could you just walk up the stairs 

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,690
no big deal right 

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,380
but then funniest thing happened 

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,020
those first few months they came and went 

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,700
and i i couldn't quite do stuff 

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,020
so we had an awesome new revised plan 

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,520
and then but then those middle months 

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
actually went by and i didn't really write words 

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,060
and so we were here and then two months 

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,940
turned into one month she turned into two weeks 

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,180
and one day i woke up with three days 

38
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,620
until the deadline still not having written a word 

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,540
and so i did the only thing i could 

40
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,810
i wrote ninety pages over seventy two hours 

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,610
pulling not one but two all nighters 

42
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,250
humans are not supposed to pull two all nighters 

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,020
sprinted across campus dove in slow motion 

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,060
and guided in just of the deadline 

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,900
and i thought that was the end of everything 

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
but a week later i get a call 

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,850
it's the school and they say is this tim urban 

48
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,410
and i say yeah and they say we need to talk 

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,570
about your thesis and i say okay 

50
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,990
and they say it's the best one we've ever seen 

51
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:34,760
a that did not happen it was a very very bad thesis 

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,040
i just wanted to enjoy that one moment 

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,680
when all of you thought this guy is amazing 

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
no no it was very very bad 

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,100
anyway today i'm a writer blogger guy 

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,660
i write the blog weight but why 

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,020
and a couple of years ago i decided 

58
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,660
to write about procrastination 

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,380
my behavior is always perplexed 

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,020
the non procrastinators around me 

61
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,380
and i wanted to explain to the non procrastinators 

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,800
of the world what goes on in the heads 

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
of procrastinators and why we are the 

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,160
where we are now at a hypothesis 

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,340
that the the brains of procrastinators 

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,300
were actually different than the brains 

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,410
of other people and to test this 

68
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,730
i found an mri lab that actually let me scan 

69
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,290
both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator 

70
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,890
and i and so i could compare them 

71
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,130
and i actually brought them here to show you today 

72
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,530
and i want you to take a look carefully 

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,810
to see if you can notice a difference 

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,850
and i know that if you're not a trained brain expert 

75
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,970
it's not that obvious but just take a look 

76
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,250
okay so here's the brain of a non procrastinator 

77
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,080
哈哈哈哈now here's my brain 

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,500
哈哈哈哈there is a difference 

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
both brains have a rational decision maker in them 

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,310
but the procrastinator's brain also has 

81
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,430
an instant gratification monkey 

82
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,230
now what does this mean for the procrastinator 

83
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,210
well means everything's fine until this happens 

84
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,580
so the rational decision maker will make 

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,860
the rational decision to do something productive 

86
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,700
but the monkey doesn't like that plan 

87
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,990
so he she takes the wheel and he says 

88
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,450
actually let's read the entire wikipedia page 

89
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,450
of the nancy kerrigan tanya harding scandal 

90
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,050
because i just remember that that happened 

91
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,300
then we're gonna go over to the fridge 

92
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,500
we're gonna see if there's anything new in there 

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,140
since ten minutes ago after that 

94
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,870
we're gonna go on a youtube spiral 

95
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,970
that starts with videos of richard feynman 

96
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,610
talking about magnets and ends much much later 

97
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,250
with us watching interviews with justin bieber's mom 

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,380
all that's gonna take a while 

99
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,980
so we're not gonna really have room 

100
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,060
on the schedule for any work today sorry 

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,840
now what is going on here 

102
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,420
the instant gratification monkey does not seem 

103
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,900
like a guy you want behind the wheel 

104
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,580
he lives entirely in the present moment 

105
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,700
he has no memory of the past 

106
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,980
no knowledge of the future 

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
and he only cares about two things 

108
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,040
easy and fun now in the animal world 

109
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
that works fine if you're a dog 

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
and you spend your whole life doing nothing 

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
other than easy and fun things 

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,820
you're a huge success and to the monkey 

113
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
humans are just another animal species 

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,320
is to keep well slept well fed 

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,360
and propagating into the next generation 

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
which in tribal times might have worked okay 

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,800
but if you haven't noticed now 

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
we're not in tribal times 

119
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,250
we're in an advanced civilization 

120
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,090
and the monkey does not know what that is 

121
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,490
which is why we have another guy in our brain 

122
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,670
the rational decision maker who gives us 

123
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,190
the ability to do things no other animal can do 

124
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,270
we can visualize the future 

125
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
we can see the big picture 

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
we can make long term plans 

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
and he wants to take all of that into account 

128
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,410
and he wants to just have us do 

129
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,090
whatever makes sense to be doing right now 

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things 

131
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,920
that are easy and fun like when you're having dinner 

132
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
or going to bed or enjoying well 

133
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,270
or in leisure time that's why there's an overlap 

134
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,830
sometimes they agree but other times 

135
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,990
it makes much more sense to be doing things 

136
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,460
that are harder and less pleasant 

137
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,900
for the sake of the big picture 

138
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,860
and that's when we have a conflict 

139
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,890
and for the procrastinator that conflict tends to end 

140
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,050
a certain way every time 

141
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,930
leaving him spending a lot of time 

142
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,860
in this orange zone an easy and fun place 

143
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,460
that's entirely out of the makes sense circle 

144
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,460
i call it the dark playground 

145
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,710
the dark playground is a place that all of you 

146
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,630
procrastinators out there know very well 

147
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
it's where leisure activities happen 

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,360
at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening 

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
the fun you have in the dark playground 

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,800
isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned 

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,910
and the air is filled with guilt dread anxiety 

152
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,390
self hatred all those good procrastinator feelings 

153
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,980
and the question is in this situation 

154
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,380
with the monkey behind the wheel 

155
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,620
how does the procrastinator ever get himself 

156
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,060
over here to this blue zone 

157
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,090
a less pleasant plates but were really important things happen 

158
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,100
well it turns out that the procrastinator 

159
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,060
has a guardian angel someone who's always looking down 

160
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,100
on him and watching over him in his darkest moments 

161
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,460
someone called the panic monster 

162
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,910
the panic monster is dormant most of the time 

163
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,010
but he suddenly wakes up any time a deadline 

164
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,610
gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment 

165
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,290
a career disaster or some other scary consequence 

166
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,620
and importantly he's the only thing 

167
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,380
that the monkey is terrified of 

168
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,590
now he became very relevant in my life pretty recently 

169
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,570
because people of ted reached out to me 

170
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,130
about six months ago and invited me to do a ted talk 

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,800
now of course i said yes it's always been a dream of mine 

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,160
to have done a ted talk in the past 

173
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,960
but in the middle of all this excitement 

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
the rational decision makers seemed to have something else 

175
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,190
in his mind he was saying we clear on what we just accepted 

176
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,320
do we do we get what's going to be now happening 

177
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
one day in the future we need to sit down 

178
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
and work on this right now 

179
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,870
and the monkey said totally agree 

180
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,429
but also let's just open google earth 

181
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,110
and lizom into the bottom of india 

182
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,190
like two hundred feet above the ground 

183
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,909
and we're gonna scroll up two and a half hours 

184
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,580
till we get to the top of the country 

185
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,780
so we can get a better feel for india 

186
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,640
哈哈哈哈so that's what we did 

187
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,060
that day has six months turned into four 

188
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,820
and then two and then one 

189
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,020
the people of ted decided to release the speakers 

190
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,610
and i opened up the website 

191
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,010
and there was my face staring right back at me 

192
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,450
and guess who woke up 

193
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
so the panic monster starts losing his mind 

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,980
and a few seconds later the whole systems in mayhem 

195
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,640
and the monkey who remember he's terrified of the panic monster 

196
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,070
boom he's up the tree and finally finally 

197
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,110
the rational decision maker can take the wheel 

198
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,470
and i can start working on the talk 

199
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,820
now the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane 

200
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,740
procrastinated behavior like how someone like me 

201
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,660
could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence 

202
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,180
of a paper and then miraculously find 

203
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,140
the unbelievable work work ethic to stay up up all night 

204
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,960
and write eight pages and this entire situation 

205
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,920
with the three characters this is the procrastinator system 

206
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,670
it's not pretty but in the end it works 

207
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,790
and this is what i decided to write about 

208
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,030
on the blog just a couple of years ago 

209
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,940
now when i did i was amazed by the response 

210
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,900
literally thousands of emails came in 

211
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,420
from all different kinds of people 

212
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,940
from all over the world doing all different kinds of things 

213
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,520
these are people who were nurses and bankers 

214
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,880
and painters and engineers and lots and lots of ph d students 

215
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,980
and they were all writing saying the same thing 

216
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,220
i have this problem too but what struck me 

217
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,700
was the contrast between the light tone of the post 

218
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,980
and the heaviness of these emails 

219
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,810
these people were writing with intense frustration 

220
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,210
about what procrastination had done to their lives 

221
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,370
about what this monkey had done to them 

222
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,620
i thought about this and i said 

223
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,100
what the procrastinator system works 

224
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,340
then what's going on why are all these people 

225
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,640
in such a dark place well it turns out 

226
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,360
that there's two kinds of procrastination 

227
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,590
everything i've talked about today 

228
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,390
the examples i've given they all have deadlines 

229
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,030
and when there's deadlines the effects of procrastination 

230
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,420
are contained to the short term 

231
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,060
because the panic monster gets involved 

232
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,900
but there's a second kind of procrastination 

233
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,020
that happens in situations when there is no deadline 

234
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,500
so if you want to have a career 

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
you want to be a self starter 

236
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,200
something in the arts something entrepreneurial 

237
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
there's no deadlines on those things at first 

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,880
because nothing's happening at first 

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
not until you've gone out and done the hard work 

240
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
to get some momentum to get things going 

241
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,410
there's also all kinds of important things 

242
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,050
outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines 

243
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,810
like seeing your family or exercising 

244
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,090
and taking care of your health 

245
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,520
working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship 

246
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,160
that isn't working now if procrastinator is only mechanism 

247
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,370
of doing these hard things is the panic monster 

248
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,330
that's a problem because in all of these non deadline situations 

249
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,460
the panic monster doesn't show up 

250
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,420
there's nothing to wake up for 

251
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,940
so the effects of procrastination they're not contained 

252
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,020
they just extend outward forever 

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,820
and it's this long term kind of procrastination 

254
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,380
that's much less visible and much less talked about 

255
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,100
than the funnier short term deadline based kind 

256
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,020
it's usually suffered quietly and privately 

257
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,970
and it can be the source of a huge amount 

258
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,810
of long term unhappiness and regrets 

259
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,890
and i thought you know that's why these people 

260
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,850
are emailing and that's why they're in such a bad place 

261
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,250
it's not that they're craming for some project 

262
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,530
it's that long term procrastination has made them feel 

263
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,450
like a spectator at times in their own lives 

264
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,640
you know the frustration was not that they couldn't achieve 

265
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,120
their dreams is that they weren't even able 

266
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,890
to start chasing them so i read these emails 

267
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,370
and i had a little bit of an epiphany 

268
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,920
that i don't think non procrastinators exist 

269
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,480
that's right i think all of you are procrastinators 

270
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,270
now you might not all be a mess like some of us 

271
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,420
and some of you may have a healthy relationship 

272
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,300
with deadlines but remember the monkey's sneakiest trick 

273
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,820
is when the deadlines aren't there 

274
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,200
now i want to show you one last thing 

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,200
i call this a life calendar 

276
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,940
that's one box for every week of a ninety year life 

277
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,580
that's not that many boxes especially since 

278
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,380
we've already used a bunch of those 

279
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,740
so i think we need to all take a long hard look 

280
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,380
at that calendar we need to think about 

281
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,380
what we're really procrastinating on 

282
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,820
because everyone is procrastinating on something in life 

283
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
we need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey 

284
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,140
that's a job for all of us 

285
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,030
and because there's not that many boxes on there 

286
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,350
it's a job that should probably start today 

287
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:44,030
well i mean not today but you know sometime soon 

288
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,590
thank you
